 Teal is a greenish-blue color. Its name comes from that of a bird—the Eurasian teal (Anas crecca)—which presents a similarly colored stripe on its head. The word is often used colloquially to refer to shades of cyan in general.
 It can be created by mixing cyan into a green base, or deepened as needed with black or gray.[2] It is also one of the first group of 16 HTML/CSS web colors. In the RGB model used to create colors on computer screens and televisions, teal is created by reducing the brightness of cyan to about one half.
 Teal was a fad color during the 1990s, with, among others, many sports teams adopting the color for their uniforms.[3][4]
 The first recorded use of teal as a color name in English was in 1917.[5] The term teal (referring to a sort of duck) is derived from the Middle English tele, a word akin to the Dutch taling and the Middle Low German telink.[6]
 Teal blue is a medium tone of teal with more blue. The first recorded use of teal blue as a color name in English was in 1927.[5]: p. 101, plate 39, color sample L6 
 The source of this color is the Plochere Color System, a color system formulated in 1948 that is widely used by interior designers. Teal was subsequently a heavily used color in the 1950s and 1960s.[8]
